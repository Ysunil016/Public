    "title": "How to grow when you are under imposter syndrome",
    "content": "<p>Whether it comes from the inside or the outside, most of us are continuously under the expectation of growth. You might want to deepen you knowledge on a subject you like or your project manager might think of you as a backfill for a leadership position. But what happens when you are in this situation while struggling with self doubt? How to take on more responsibilities when you are paralized by your insecurities?</p><p>As most of the devs I met, I never wanted to become a tech lead. I like writing code, coming up with a cleaner solution, finding a smart of way of getting rid of that particularly nasty code smell, paying tech debt. I didn’t want to spend more of my time in meetings or dealing with clients. But once I was in a situation where all senior devs had left and no one else on the team had more knowledge about the business domain and tech stack than I did. So the setting was entirely against what I wanted and I was the obvious choice for the tech lead position, so a conversation was scheduled.</p><p>I was proud of my behavior during the meeting. All the time I was firmly using a valuable skill everyone should develop: saying “no”. I didn’t want more responsibilities, I didn’t want to deal with meeting and clients, I just wanted to develop more of my core dev skills. I stood my ground, but honestly, the underlying truth was: I wanted to be comfortable and I was afraid of failing.</p><p>I'm always talking about feedback and I feel it is one of the most valuable tools you could have under your belt. It has its limitations, for sure. You can’t rely on it to figure out where you want to go, but it’s the best thing in the world when it comes to bringing you back to reality. And feedback doesn’t always come with a flashing sign all caps saying “FEEDBACK”. The folks trying to convince me I was ready to become a tech lead were saying, in other words, that I was ready, that I was good enough for the challenge and that I just didn’t see it. When I started leaning towards accepting the offer I asked two very direct and honest questions: Are you sure I am good enough for this position? If so, are you willing to share the responsibility in case I fail? They said yes and so did I.</p>",

    "content": "<p>This is the third of a series that unpacks our four accountabilities, which are:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bla_bla_bla.net/ange-ferguson/service-lines-the-four-accountabilities-drive-differentiation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drive Differentiation</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bla_bla_bla.net/ange-ferguson/service-lines-the-four-accountabilities-drive-profitable-growth\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drive Profitable Growth</a>; Build Capabilities and Curate Knowledge.</p><p>If you haven’t read my earlier post on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bla_bla_bla.net/ange-ferguson/service-lines-on-measurement-and-a-refresh-on-why-service-lines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">why Service Lines</a> and on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bla_bla_bla.net/ange-ferguson/service-lines-our-guiding-principles\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our guiding principles</a> I suggest you go and do that now.</p><p>Today we’re going to take a look at&nbsp;<strong>Build Capabilities</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h2><i><strong>Build Capabilities</strong></i></h2><p><i>Develop expertise through specialist skill development</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>First we have “develop expertise”</strong></h4><p>The nature of professional services firms is that <strong>our biggest asset is our people, our capabilities and our knowledge</strong>. Even though on the surface, it appears that we are selling our time, clients are buying that collective asset.</p><p>And so the speed at which we can build capabilities (and knowledge - but more on that one soon) at scale becomes an important competitive advantage.</p><p>Importantly the desire and ability to learn and grow together is central to our culture.</p><h4><strong>Then we have “specialist skill development”</strong></h4><p>Service lines are <strong>not a home for specialists</strong>, rather they provide a focus in which to develop and grow services in a specific area. This often requires the development of specialist skills, some of which may be new to us, but it also requires many very familiar skills, sometimes used in familiar ways, sometimes used in new and different ways.</p><p>Service lines are <strong>not a home for our most senior, most experienced consultants</strong>. In the early days of establishment, sure, we may skew a little more senior, but as we grow, leverage will be key - and the primary reason for this is capability development (though there are other benefits too).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h2><i><strong>Build Capabilities</strong></i></h2><p><i>Develop expertise through specialist skill development</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, as with all four key accountabilities, capability development is not only a service line concern, <strong>so let’s now focus on what it means for Service Lines to build capabilities.</strong></p><p>Service Lines help support these informal methods by providing both a focal point (or four, actually) and a global structure to support capability development in a more systematic and scaled way.</p><p>And no, we are not outsourcing capability development to Service Lines, and no, you don't need to be in a Service Line to grow new capabilities.</p><p>For capabilities that are emerging or scarce, Service Lines seek to incubate those capabilities, reducing scarcity through both learning and hiring.</p><p>And the point of an incubator is not to grow more eggs, but to produce chickens that can survive outside the incubator when released. My metaphors are often problematic, so let’s leave that one behind.</p><p>The point is, as we reduce scarcity of a particular capability, we will look to <strong>shift the centre of gravity for that capability from the service line to the market</strong>, partnering with L&amp;D to do so.</p><p>And then finally, for more established, available capabilities, Service Lines will continue to take a consultative role, with L&amp;D and Communities taking the lead.</p><h3><strong>And how will we know that we are effectively executing on this accountability?</strong></h3><p>As with everything it’ll be a combination of leading and lagging, qualitative, quantitative and anecdotal indicators. And some will be measured in combination with others among the four accountabilities. Here are a few of the things we are thinking about, in no particular order:</p><ul><li>Faster reduction of scarcity for new/emerging capabilities</li><li>Transition of services from explore to exploit to sustain</li><li>Transition of service line role from drive to advise for a given capability</li><li>Creation and adoption of learning assets</li><li>Leverage and targeted assignments</li><li>Over time, increase proportion of build over hire</li><li>A wider variety of growth paths for Thoughtworkers</li></ul><p>To execute successfully will require us to continue pushing the boundaries of what we can learn, both individually and organisationally, and to have a collective culture of ‘learn together’ at our core as we grow.</p><p>And so …</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h2><i><strong>Build Capabilities</strong></i></h2><p><i>Develop expertise through specialist skill development</i></p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The next accountability I’ll dive into is that of&nbsp;<strong>Curate Knowledge</strong>, and while I am taking these one by one they are clearly accountabilities that have significant intersection and overlap.</p><p>So that's it - what questions do you have? What are you curious about?&nbsp;</p><p>Ange</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:40px;text-align:center;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Have you had difficulty handling stakeholders or did you avoid talking to stakeholders? Well, not anymore!</p><figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stakeholder Management: Piece of cake\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/0_Mw_qo_Z4_Pj8_M9_Pf_Dd_18070c9ce3/0_Mw_qo_Z4_Pj8_M9_Pf_Dd_18070c9ce3.gif\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Let us look at the thumb rules and basic principles for handling different stakeholders and winning their trust.</p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>Disclaimer: These are just the basic principles and will work for most scenarios. Also, this article is not about influencing or managing the conflicts with the stakeholders. I intend to keep the scope of this article limited to understanding the mindset of stakeholders, essentially learning how to and not what to.</i></p></blockquote><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</h2><h3 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Principle 1: Know Who?</strong></h3><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The first thumb rule even before managing your stakeholders is to understand <i>who your stakeholders are. </i>You should also understand their interest and influence level for your product.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stakeholder Mapping\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/1_YS_2_Ka_Dfho87s_XT_9_RKRPMGQ_e9630a7b8b/1_YS_2_Ka_Dfho87s_XT_9_RKRPMGQ_e9630a7b8b.png\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Once the stakeholders are identified, shortlist the stakeholders who have <strong>High Interest and High Influencing Power</strong>. Remember the states of the stakeholders might keep changing as we progress with dealing with multiple stakeholders and over time interest or influencing power of the stakeholders may also change. So, the best way is to keep a tab on the stakeholders frequently possibly every sprint with the entire team.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</h2><h3 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Principle 2: The Key</strong></h3><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">When a team starts engaging with the stakeholders, one understands that the stakeholders are at point zero with the product details or the implementation i.e., they are unaware.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">There are various stages that a stakeholder goes through in an engagement:</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><code><i>Unaware -&gt; Aware -&gt; Neutral -&gt; Supportive -&gt; Leading</i></code></p><figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stages of stakeholder\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/0_6mp_TO_9_ZM_Km_Vo_Ony_I_fad345f405/0_6mp_TO_9_ZM_Km_Vo_Ony_I_fad345f405.png\"></figure><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">And the objective here is to make the stakeholders aware of the product and move them to the leading state. Well, how do we do that? This brings us to our second principle of stakeholder management <strong>“Relationship Building” and “Trust”</strong>. Staying authentic to our stakeholders and having frequent catchups formally or informally might help in having the base.</p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>Disclaimer: Relation building is very tricky and would vary from person to person and situation to situation.</i></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Listen and Understand:</strong> Sometimes just hearing them out and understanding their point of view might just help. This would also ensure ruling out the assumptions. Ensuring that the stakeholders are also on the same page as you are is the key here.</p><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</h2><h3 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Principle 3: Cracking the Nut</strong></h3><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Aristotle has given us the <strong>3 modes of persuasion</strong> — Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. These are how a person can win over their audience. As we have already mentioned that not every person is the same and not the same trick would work for everyone. However, these 3 modes can be tried by various individuals and one can identify the best technique to convince or influence the stakeholders.</p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>Note: Having open-ended questions at the beginning of the conversation might help in unfolding the nature and culture of the stakeholders.</i></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>Ethos (Credibility), Pathos(Emotions), and Logos(Logic)</i> are also known as <strong>Rhetorical appeals. </strong>You can read more about them <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>. Once we unlock the trick, all we have to do is find the right balance between the three modes and present the idea accordingly.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Modes of Persuasion\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/0_99z_Y_Vc7lrne2b3x5_c580efcf7b/0_99z_Y_Vc7lrne2b3x5_c580efcf7b.png\"></figure><h2 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</h2><h3 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Principle 4: The Process</strong></h3><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">As we deal with multiple stakeholders, we are bound to take certain decisions. Stakeholders always want more and have weird asks. How do we make such decisions and have a win-win call? Well, the process of how these decisions are taken, counts. The mantra is to be agile and stay empathetic to stakeholders. <i>Make stakeholders the hero in their journey</i> and ensure that have the last word.</p><blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>Disclaimer: Being agile does not mean that we say “yes” to everything that stakeholders ask. It’s about collaboration and maintaining sustainability.</i></p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><i>What's in it for me? </i>— Every individual on this planet or maybe outside as well (if it exists) always thinks about the self-benefit first and then about others. Remember to talk about the <i>benefits the stakeholders </i>will get rather that the features of the product. You may have awesome features, fancy screens, the latest technologies, and everything but if none of these brings benefit to the stakeholders then the product is just like a Showpiece.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">This takes me to talk about <strong>6 Principles of Persuasion</strong> that once can use to persuade the stakeholders:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Principles of Persuasion\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/0_m_S9a_Hi7i_M9_S8o_I5s_cd76833c69/0_m_S9a_Hi7i_M9_S8o_I5s_cd76833c69.png\"></figure><ol><li><strong>Reciprocity: </strong>This works on the principle of returning the favors to people who have in turn done something in the past.</li><li><strong>Liking: </strong>The principle behind “Liking” is to be a little biased towards the people we like. Building a great rapport and trust develops the liking among the people</li><li><strong>Commitment: </strong>Ensuring that one has delivered what was said or committed. Commitment is all about achievements.</li><li><strong>Authority:</strong> Gaining confidence via authority. Essentially, people are likely to trust a credible and widely known source more easily than an unknown source.</li><li><strong>Social Proof/Consensus:</strong> Following the leader. This works on the principle of the fact that if something is working well for others, then it would work for me too.</li><li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> People tend to value things that might be going in scarce or maybe less available.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Principle 5: Being Mean</strong></h3><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Yes, that’s right…! Be mean and make use of existing stakeholders with whom you have built your trust to open up connections with other stakeholders. As I mentioned earlier, one must keep a tab and be <i>mindful of the state of various stakeholders</i>. This also helps in understanding where our stakeholders lie and who can we ask for favors to open up gates to other high-interest and high influential stakeholders. Remember, we have also talked about that there would be stakeholders whose interests and influence would vary based on time and situations. At the same time, we might also have stakeholders incoming and outgoing. In a nutshell, be mean and <i>leverage the existing connection to build new connections.</i></p><hr><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Before wrapping up, I would like to introduce you to the Types of Stakeholders we deal with in our day-to-day activity who are part of the Decision-Making Unit(DMU).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Decision Making Unit for an organization\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/0_C5_LK_2no67_Aq_Zq_FD_ba66ae6ddb/0_C5_LK_2no67_Aq_Zq_FD_ba66ae6ddb.jpeg\"></figure><ol><li><strong>Decision Maker:</strong> One who has the final say in an organization</li><li><strong>Influencers: </strong>These are the ones who persuade others or make recommendations based on experience and their knowledge of the product.</li><li><strong>Gatekeeper: </strong>Gatekeepers are the ones who have the authority to press the stop/to go button and provide their inputs to the decision-makers.</li></ol><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Voila!

(<i>image source : sessionlab.com</i>)</figcaption></figure><p>Currently working in the role of a Business Analyst, participating and facilitating meetings is like bread and butter for me. More times than less, I would end up facilitating different meetings whether, for example, it's with your internal team members or client stakeholders. I feel the same may be true for many others though you don’t need to be BA to understand and connect with this.</p><p>Eventually a facilitator is one person who has the weight of the world (<i> just joking</i>) on their head so that meetings remain effective, upto the point and end with an outcome driven and accepted action items.&nbsp;<br><br>I have had frequent opportunities to facilitate meetings and felt that I was doing ok. But I never received any feedback till a year and half back about my facilitation skills. Feedback provided me the opportunity to reflect upon what I am doing well or which are my improvement areas.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to improve my facilitation skills, I discussed with my performance partner where she recommended this great book by Michael Wilkinson (<i>want to know the book name, read on</i>). There on, I&nbsp; embarked upon this journey to be a better facilitator and learnt a few secrets which I am about to reveal below<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Reflection on definition of Facilitation<br>&nbsp;</h3><blockquote><p><i>A facilitated session is a highly structured meeting in which the facilitator guides the participants through a series of predefined steps to arrive at a result which is&nbsp;<strong>created</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>understood</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>accepted</strong> by all the participants.</i></p></blockquote><p><br>Definition above forms the crux of facilitation. To reflect upon this statement, let's look at key components of the above definition.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/statement_breakdown_1d4d24c7c8/statement_breakdown_1d4d24c7c8.png\" alt=\"statement breakdown\"><figcaption>What is a facilitated session?</figcaption></figure><h3>Fundamental Secret of Facilitation<br>&nbsp;</h3><p>While there are numerous secrets of facilitation which make conducting meetings more effective, there is one which is pretty fundamental and needs a special mention. It can simply be stated in a formulaic form.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Effective Decision(ED)&nbsp;</strong></i><br><i><strong>=&nbsp;</strong></i><br><i><strong>the Right Decision (RD)*</strong></i><br><i><strong>Commitment to the decision(CD)</strong></i></p></blockquote><p><br><i>Let’s take an example to understand how both a right decision and the corresponding commitment to the decision makes a decision effective eventually . Otherwise we could well be looking at a stalemate with no real progress made after the meeting.</i></p><p><i>Consider a business analyst who goes into a meeting without representation from other team members and commits to a timeline for a feature which would drastically change the system architecture.&nbsp;</i><br><br><i>BA kept the team's interest at centre and got sufficient time to build that feature (using his wide ranging experience) but eventually the team was not happy with the decision. They felt they were not heard and the decision was made in haste. They had other ideas to share with the wider group.</i><br><br>So in this case while the right decision may have been made in terms of giving the team sufficient time to work on the feature but team felt left out of the decision which impacted their commitment to the feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>This basically brings home the point that a right decision itself is not sufficient. You need the commitment of all stakeholders involved.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><h3><br>Principles of SMART Facilitation</h3><p><br>S.M.A.R.T. refers to Structured Meeting and Relating Techniques. These techniques are guiding steps on how a SMART facilitator would go about facilitating meetings.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-imgs/Principles_of_SMART_Facilitation_f5073e9a9e/Principles_of_SMART_Facilitation_f5073e9a9e.png\" alt=\"principles\"><figcaption>Principles of SMART Facilitation</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Asking Questions</strong><br><br>Making sure that questions are designed in a way that it brings the imagination of participants to the fore very early into the session and they can visualize the problem at hand. It may also be prudent not start with a question which is directly linked with the topic on hand but something similar.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Preparing for Success</strong><br><br>5 P’s to preparing for success<br><br><ul><li><strong>Purpose</strong> - Clear purpose on why we are meeting</li><li><strong>Product</strong> -&nbsp; What is produced as an outcome? How do we know we are successful?</li><li><strong>Participants</strong> - Understanding participants who need to join and their perspectives</li><li><strong>Probable Issues -&nbsp;</strong>Issues that could arise which may prevent us from creating the product</li><li><strong>Process</strong> : Steps that should be taken to achieve the intended outcome</li></ul></li><li><strong>Getting the session started</strong></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">It is important to set the context upfront so that participants understand why they are here and making them feel important in the decision making process so as to make them excited early about the session.</p><ul><li><strong>Focusing the group</strong><br><br>It is important to keep the group focused during the meeting - avoiding long conversations and detours. Make use of the parking lot if necessary.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Information Gathering</strong><br><br>Facilitated sessions tend to generate a lot of information. Select the tools which you are comfortable with as a facilitator.&nbsp;<br><br>e.g. <i>For virtual meetings, it may be the software you would be interacting through or one being used for collaboration. Make sure that you are able to drive through the meeting making best use of such tools. Arrange a co-facilitator with you if you need support for the facilitation.</i><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Using the Pen</strong><br><br>It's important to capture the information from participants. But as a facilitator , one needs to be neutral in capturing notes. Capturing notes in the words of participants brings in the trust factor with the participants and they feel valued seeing their thoughts are being captured.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Closing the session</strong><br><br>Finally it's important to close out the session even if you can’t complete all items on the agenda. Keep some time to review the meeting outcomes, evaluate against the agenda , plan out next steps and action items before closing.</li></ul><h3>Group Dynamics<br>&nbsp;</h3><p>Along with the above, in a facilitated session, group dynamics is also at play. So these 4 principles also play a key role before and during a facilitated session.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Agenda Setting</strong><br><br>While it goes without saying that the agenda is utmost important for any facilitated session.
